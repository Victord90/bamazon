# bamazon


## Overview


In this assignment, I made Bamazon. Bamazon is a online store to purchase a couple of items available. It is not a actual live store but in this assignment I show that I learned how to connect mysql to my javascript using node. Anything you buy will effect the mysql database and remove those items from the quantities. 


## Instructions

To use this app clone the repository onto your computer and make sure to npm install all the dependencies to make sure the app works properly.
Once installed open your terminal and see the magic!

- Start by typing (node bamazon.js) for the store to open up for you.
- Once it opens you will see the inventory first then be asked if you would like to buy anything and to enter the ID of the item. 
- After that just follow the steps and enjoy bamazon!!
